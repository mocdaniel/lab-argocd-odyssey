title: "ArgoCD Odyssey: From Basics to Brilliance"
---

This workshop provides a thorough introduction to [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd),
an open-source GitOps solution for Kubernetes.

The workshop is designed to build on minimal prior knowledge, though
it is recommended to have some familiarity with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
[Helm](https://helm.sh), and [Git](https://git-scm.com).

## Navigation

You can navigate the workshop content using the **Continue** button at the
bottom of each page, or by using the **Table of Contents** and **Arrow**
buttons at the top of this window.

## Terminal

In addition to instructions, you are provided with a terminal to
follow along.

In the terminal, you have access to many useful tools common to a Kubernetes
environment or useful for this workshop, e.g.:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - the Kubernetes CLI
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) - a package manager for Kubernetes
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) - a terminal UI for Kubernetes
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - a version control system
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) - the GitHub CLI
- [argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/commands/argocd/#argocd) - the ArgoCD CLI

## IDE and Slides

Next to your **terminal**, you will find tabs for a **Visual Studio Code**
instance as well as this workshop's accompanying **slides**.

Switch between the different tabs to access the different tools;
state and progress are preserved throughout your session.
