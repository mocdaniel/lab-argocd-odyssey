title: ArgoCD Odyssey: From Basics to Brilliance
---

This workshop provides a thorough introduction to [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd),
an open-source GitOps solution for Kubernetes.

The workshop is designed to build on minimal prior knowledge, though
it is recommended to have some familiarity with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
[Helm](https://helm.sh), and [Git](https://git-scm.com).

## Navigation

You can navigate the workshop content using the **Continue** button at the
bottom of each page, or by using the **Table of Contents** and **Arrow**
buttons at the top of this window.

## Terminal

In addition to instructions, you are provided with two terminals to
follow along with the workshop. In the terminal, you have access to
many useful tool common to a Kubernetes environment, such as `kubectl`,
`helm`, or `k9s`.

## IDE and Slides

Next to your **terminal**, you find buttons for a **Visual Studio Code**
instance as well as this workshop's accompanying **slides**.
Switch between the different tabs to access the different tools;
state and progress are preserved across the different tabs.

## Codeblocks

Codeblocks throughout this workshop are **executable**. You can run
the contained code by simply **clicking the code block**. This
will execute the code in the terminal on the right.
